# Methodology Improvements: Lessons from an Underpowered A/B Test

## Executive Summary

This A/B test revealed critical gaps in our experimentation methodology. The extremely low statistical power (6.8%) rendered results inconclusive, transforming this from a simple landing page test into a valuable case study in experimental design.

## Key Lessons Identified

###  Statistical Power Awareness
**Problem**: Test launched without power analysis
**Impact**: 93.2% chance of missing real effects (Type II errors)
**Lesson**: Power analysis is non-negotiable for reliable experimentation

###  Sample Size Planning
**Problem**: Arbitrary test duration and sample size
**Impact**: Inability to detect practically significant differences
**Lesson**: Calculate required sample size before test initiation

###  Effect Size Considerations
**Problem**: No minimum detectable effect size defined
**Impact**: Unclear what business impact would justify launch
**Lesson**: Define MDE based on business objectives, not statistical convenience

## Improved Framework for Future Tests

### Pre-Test Checklist
```markdown
- [ ] Define business objective and success metrics
- [ ] Calculate required sample size using power analysis
- [ ] Set minimum detectable effect (MDE) based on business impact
- [ ] Determine test duration considering seasonality
- [ ] Plan for segmentation analysis upfront
- [ ] Set up monitoring for sample ratio mismatch
