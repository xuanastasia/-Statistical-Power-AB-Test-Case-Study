# Business Recommendation: Landing Page A/B Test

## Executive Summary

**Recommendation:**  **DO NOT LAUNCH** the new landing page

**Decision Basis:** The A/B test results are statistically inconclusive with a concerning negative trend. Launching the new page carries unacceptable business risk without evidence of improvement.

## Key Metrics

| Business Metric | Result | Implication |
|----------------|---------|-------------|
| **Conversion Rate (Control)** | 12.9% | Baseline performance |
| **Conversion Rate (Treatment)** | 12.8% | -0.15% absolute decrease |
| **Relative Change** | -1.2% | Negative trend observed |
| **Statistical Significance** | Not Significant (p=0.229) | Results could be due to chance |
| **Potential Impact** | -14 conversions per 10k users | Revenue risk if trend is real |

## Risk Assessment

### ðŸŸ¡ Business Risk
- **Potential Conversion Loss**: If the observed -1.2% trend is real, we risk losing conversions
- **Opportunity Cost**: Resources spent on development without proven benefit
- **User Experience**: Unknown impact on user satisfaction and retention

### ðŸ”´ Statistical Risk
- **Low Power (6.8%)**: Test was highly unlikely to detect real differences
- **Inconclusive Results**: Confidence interval includes both negative and positive effects
- **False Negative Risk**: We cannot confidently say the new page is worse OR better

## Strategic Rationale

### Why We Recommend Keeping the Old Page
1. **"First, Do No Harm"**: The old page has proven performance at 12.9% conversion
2. **Risk Asymmetry**: Potential downside (-1.2%) outweighs potential upside
3. **Evidence Standard**: No statistical evidence supports the new page's superiority
4. **Resource Preservation**: Avoid wasting engineering and marketing resources on unproven changes

### Financial Impact
- **Conservative Estimate**: Potential loss of 14 conversions per 10,000 visitors
- **Scale Impact**: At 100,000 monthly visitors â†’ ~140 lost conversions monthly
- **Customer Lifetime Value**: Each lost conversion represents lost future revenue

## Next Steps

### Immediate Actions
1. **Maintain current landing page** in production
2. **Communicate decision** to stakeholders with data justification
3. **Preserve test setup** for potential future re-testing

### Future Considerations
1. **Re-test with proper sample size** if business priority remains high
2. **Conduct user research** to understand why the new design underperformed
3. **Iterate on design** based on qualitative feedback before next quantitative test

## Stakeholder Communication

**To Leadership Team:**
> "After rigorous analysis, we recommend keeping our current landing page. The new design showed a slight decrease in conversions, but more importantly, our test lacked the statistical power to make a reliable decision. Launching would mean gambling with our conversion rate without evidence of improvement."

**To Product/Engineering:**
> "The A/B test results were inconclusive due to sample size limitations. We recommend pausing the launch and either re-testing with proper power or iterating on the design based on additional user feedback."

**Confidence Level**: High (in the decision to not launch)
